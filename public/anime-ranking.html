<h1>BEST ANIME ACCORDING TO RAJKUMAR</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>ATTACK ON TITAN</h3>

<p>It is THE ANIME. Generation defining piece of media, that transcends the realms of mere Anime.</p> 
<h3>VINLAND SAGA</h3>

<p>Never experienced themes like violence, revenge, love, faith and morality potrayed so beautifully.</p> 
<h3>MONSTER</h3>

<p>Dives deep into the mind of an extremely nihilistic human being. Binging through Monster is one of the best experiences.</p>
